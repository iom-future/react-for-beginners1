The context API is like a portal

the UserContext.jsx if the building where we create the portal, it has:
    the engine: export let UserContext = createContext();
    the portal structure(just like the container where the engine is): this is the UserProvider component
    the value attribute of the engine, is what is teleported to various building(component file)

The portal is the used in App as follows:
     <UserProvider>
            <UpdateUser />
            <UserProfile />
    </UserProvider>

    the provider component is the building(the portal) so the things inside it[whe
    n its been used] are where the data(in value attribute) will be teleported to

The data teleported:
    in the component where the data was teleported to in the portal, you can use it by getting the package:
    import { UserContext } from "./UserContext.jsx" //getting the package

    then use the use context hook to unpackage, and finally get the raw data:  let {userName} =useContext(UserContext)
